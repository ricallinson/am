# Automatic Marcus

A 3D printed foam dart gun powered by an Arduino. Inspired by [Project FDL](http://www.projectfdl.com/) the AM-1 aims to be a cheap and accurate form dart gun compatible with both [Nerf N-Strike](https://nerf.hasbro.com/en-us/toys-games/nerf:elite) and/or [AR-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_AR-15#AR-15_marketplace) accessories such as grips, stocks, etc.
